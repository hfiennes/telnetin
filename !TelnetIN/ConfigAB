; This entry is designed to connect to ARCbbs in 'pipe' modem
; mode. It uses 'autodrop' - after the arcbbs login has finished,
; the modem server will disconnect, and the init string satisfies
; arcbbs's pipe modem type automatically. The hello string is sent
; to the calling arcterm. No password is defined or needed in this
; entry.
